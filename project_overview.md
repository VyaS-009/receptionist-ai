# Project Overview: VirtualCallAI â€“ AI-Powered Voice Assistant for Enterprises

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**VirtualCallAI** is an intelligent, always-available voice assistant designed for enterprises. It can receive incoming voice calls, understand user intent in natural language, and perform context-aware actions such as booking appointments, answering frequently asked questions, or routing conversationsâ€”all autonomously, without human intervention.

The assistant integrates voice capabilities with cutting-edge AI models, enabling real-time, natural, and professional interactions with customers. Ideal for service-based businesses (e.g., clinics, salons, repair shops), VirtualCallAI automates appointment scheduling and customer interactionsâ€”reducing operational costs and improving customer experience.
